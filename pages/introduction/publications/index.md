For a none technical overview of the tool setting it in context, see the following article in the October 2020 issue of Railwatch magazine:

* Railfuture (2020, October). Essential tool to aid rail campaigners and politicians to reverse Beeching. *Railwatch*, 165, 12-13.

The following conference paper gives a useful overview of the SDFT and the underlying station choice and trip end model (note that the web interface discussed in this paper is not part of the open source code):
